# E-Commerce-Sales-Dashboard


## Overview
This project involves analyzing two datasets: **Details.csv** and **Orders.csv**. The primary objectives include understanding the data structure, deriving meaningful insights, and preparing the data for further analysis or visualization. The results can help inform business decisions, identify trends, and optimize operational strategies.

## File Descriptions

### 1. **Details.csv**
**Details.csv** contains supplementary information related to customers, products, or other entities involved in the business operations. The data might include demographic details, product descriptions, or other attributes.

**Expected columns:**
- `CustomerID` (unique identifier for customers)
- `ProductID` (unique identifier for products)
- `Category`
- `Region`
- `Price`
- Other relevant details

### 2. **Orders.csv**
**Orders.csv** records transaction details, capturing the operational flow of orders and their statuses. This dataset allows tracking of sales performance and customer behavior.

**Expected columns:**
- `OrderID` (unique identifier for each order)
- `CustomerID` (to link with Details.csv)
- `OrderDate`
- `Quantity`
- `TotalAmount`
- `Status` (e.g., Completed, Pending, Cancelled)

## Objectives of the Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Remove duplicates and handle missing values.
   - Normalize data types and formats (e.g., date fields).

2. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Analyze key metrics such as average order value, most purchased products, and customer distribution by region.

3. **Data Relationships and Trends:**
   - Identify correlations between product categories and regions.
   - Analyze sales trends over time.
   
4. **Customer Segmentation:**
   - Segment customers based on purchase behavior (e.g., frequency, total spend).

5. **Sales and Revenue Insights:**
   - Determine top-performing products and regions.
   - Calculate revenue growth over time.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python** (for data manipulation and analysis)
- **Pandas** (data wrangling)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (data visualization)
- **Power BI/Tableau** (optional for advanced visualization)

## Steps for Analysis
1. Load both datasets into Python using Pandas.
2. Explore and clean the data.
3. Merge datasets on `CustomerID` or relevant keys, if necessary.
4. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns.
5. Generate visualizations to highlight key findings.
6. Summarize insights and prepare a report.
